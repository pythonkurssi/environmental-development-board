# AZ-Envy - environmental development board demo

## Details

Sensor          | Pin / Address
----------------|--------------
MQ2 gas sensor  | ADC 0
SHT30 temperature and humidity sensor | I2C address 0x44
Onboard led     | Pin 2 (inversed: 1=off, 0=on)
Flash button    | Pin 0 (HIGH Run, LOW Flash)


## Getting started

> *"The micro-USB jack of the AZ-Envy is used for power supply. To program the microcontroller chip, you need a separately available USB to serial adapter like our FT232RL module."*
>
> https://www.az-delivery.de/en/products/az-envy

Connect your FT232RL module to the headers of your AZ-Envy development board, and the FT232RL to your computer's USB port. You will also need to power the board with a separate USB cable, which can be connected to either a power supply or your PC.


## Erasing flash

When erasing the flash, first type in the command `py -m esptool --port COM3 erase_flash`. When esptool starts connecting, hold the flash button and click the reset button. When connection is established, you can release the flash button.

```
> py -m esptool --port COM3 erase_flash
